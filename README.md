# Sales Management Report (Power BI & SQL)
Built a dashboard on Power BI based on the requirements of a fictional sales manager which utilizes data extracted from a SQL (MS SQL Server)  database. 

The dashboard highlights key performance indicators relevant to the requirements of the sales manager such as budget, sales, costumers location, sales performance over time, sales in different categories, sales performance in various cities. Alongside this, several filters were put in place to make it easiers for various salespersons to monitor sales performance relevant to them as indicated by the sales manager. 

The data was gathered from MS adventureworks, 3 years of internet sales data was filtered from the database, cleaned in SQL and extracted into CSV which were all exported to Power BI. Then  I used PowerQuery to aggregate and further clean the data, I also model the data in Power BI which consisted of 5 tables.
